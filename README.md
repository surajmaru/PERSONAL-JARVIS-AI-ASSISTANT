🧠 Jarvis – My Personal AI Assistant

Hey! This is Jarvis, my personal AI assistant — my own little version of Iron Man’s J.A.R.V.I.S. 😄
It runs completely offline, powered by Ollama with the Mistral model, so everything happens locally and stays private.

Jarvis listens, thinks, and talks back instantly using Edge TTS for natural, smooth voice responses. It supports both voice and text input, replies in real time, and feels super responsive — no long delays or robotic speech.

💡 About
Jarvis is my take on building a real-time, offline AI assistant that actually feels alive — fast, private, and smart.
It already supports memory, smooth streaming voice output, and smart home control, and I’m always working to make it even better.
